This file describes how to get everything installed in order to write
your first test. There are four cases, depending on whether you
already have Leiningen installed and whether this hotel's network is
working.

Note: I've assumed most people will have Unix laptops (Linux or
Macs). I don't have installation instructions for Windows. Sorry.
I suggest you pair up with a Unix person.

If the network is working, you can get the workshop directory like this:

   % git clone https://github.com/marick/lambda-jam

You can also get it from one of the thumb drives that are floating
around.

All the instructions below assume you installed the workshop directory
into `Desktop/lambda-jam`. Adjust as necessary. They also assume your
current working directory is the root of the contents:

   % cd ~/Desktop/lambda-jam


====== You already have Leiningen installed AND the network is available.

1. Give `lein midje` a trial run:

   % cd life 
   % lein midje

   You should see this message: "No facts were checked. Is that what
   you wanted?"


====== You already have Leiningen installed AND the network is NOT available.

1. Save away your existing Maven (Java jar) repository:
   % mv ~/.m2 ~/old-maven-repository

2. Replace it with a prepopulated maven repository:

   % mv network-free-install/m2 ~/.m2 

   (Note that the dot is important.)

3. Give `lein midje` a trial run:

   % cd life 
   % lein midje

   You should see this message: "No facts were checked. Is that what
   you wanted?"

====== You do NOT have Leiningen installed BUT the network is available.

1. Leiningen installs what it needs when it's first run, but you have to tell
   the shell where it is. The simple way to do that is the following:

   % export PATH=$PATH:~/Desktop/lambda-jam/bin

   (Note: you must do that in each new shell / terminal window you open. You can 
   also add that line to a `~/.bashrc` or equivalent file, if you know how to do that.) 

2. Make leiningen pull down all that it needs.

   % lein 

   You should see messages about downloading, then a list of available tasks.

3. Make leiningen install everything else the exercises need:

   % cd life 
   % lein midje

   You should see this message: "No facts were checked. Is that what
   you wanted?"

====== You do NOT have Leiningen installed AND the network is NOT available.

1. Leiningen installs what it needs when it's first run, but you have to tell
   the shell where it is. The simple way to do that is the following:

   % export PATH=$PATH:~/Desktop/lambda-jam/bin

   (Note: you must do that in each new shell / terminal window you open. You can 
   also add that line to a `~/.bashrc` or equivalent file, if you know how to do that.) 

2. Do you have an existing Maven (Java jarfile) repository? (You can check with `ls -ld ~/.m2`.)
   If so, save it:

   % mv ~/.m2 ~/old-maven-repository

3. Replace it with a prepopulated maven repository:

   % mv network-free-install/m2 ~/.m2 

   (Note that the dot is important.)

4. Do Leiningen's initialization for it:

   % mv network-free-install/lein ~/.lein

   (Note that the dot is important.)

5. Give `lein midje` a trial run:

   % cd life
   % lein midje

   You should see this message: "No facts were checked. Is that what
   you wanted?"
